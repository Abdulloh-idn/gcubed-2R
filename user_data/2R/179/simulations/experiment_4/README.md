# Anticipation effect for an investment tax credit

The experiment compares an anticipated investment tax credit policy to an unanticipated investment tax credit policy.

It uses two simulation layers that differ in terms of their event year.

It uses two design files, one for each simulation layer.

The Python script calculates the deviations between the two final projections to determine the impact of the anticipation effect.
